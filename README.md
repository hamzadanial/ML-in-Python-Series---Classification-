## ✅ What’s Inside

- 🔢 **Visualizing the First Digit**  
  Load and display a handwritten digit from the MNIST dataset using `matplotlib`.

- 📉 **Visualizing Digits with PCA**  
  Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce 784-dimensional images to 2D, and visualize digit clusters.

- 🏠 **Housing Dataset (Regression Preview)**  
  Load a real-world housing dataset for future regression tasks.

- 📈 **Visualize Housing Features**  
  Use scatter plots to understand the spread and distribution of feature values.
